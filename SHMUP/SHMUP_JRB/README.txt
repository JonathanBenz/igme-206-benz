Itch.io Build: https://johnny290.itch.io/shmup-jrb

MAKE IT YOUR OWN: Making my own custom assets using Adobe Photoshop.
The player plays as a pizza that shoots pepperoni at the healthy fruits such as enemy strawberries and watermelons. 

CONTROLS: WASD to move, Spacebar to shoot. 

HEALTH SYSTEM: During gameplay, the player has a health bar. If that healthbar goes to zero, then guess what? GAME OVER!

PROJECTILE DELAY: There is a 1/3rd second delay between projectile shots. No spamming allowed! I check this by checking a timer and a bool value. 

ENEMIES: 

    1. The Strawberry - Initializes at a random y-value to the right of the screen, moves to the left with each update. 
    2. The Watermelon - Same thing. 

Release Notes are available within this same project directory.
